              <h2>Phone Debloat</h2>
              <p>
                I'd like to downgrade to a dumbphone or a minimalist phone one
                day. My hang-up right now is that I use my phone for a number of
                things, and if I switched to a phone with fewer features, I'd
                end up either losing out on these things (some of which I view
                as a neccesity) or at the very least I'd need to find a new
                tool/device/system to replace these features with. I figured
                step one was to reduce the amount of uses I have for my phone.
