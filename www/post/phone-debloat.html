                I'd like to downgrade to a dumbphone or a minimalist phone one
                day. My hang-up right now is that I use my phone for a number of
                things, and if I switched to a phone with fewer features, I'd
                end up either losing out on these things (some of which I view
                as a neccesity) or at the very least I'd need to find a new
                tool/device/system to replace these features with. I figured
                step one was to reduce the amount of uses I have for my phone.

            I have always eyed those who use dumbphones, flip phones, and
            minimalist phones with something akin to awe. I too want to have a
            simple life and not feel as if I need<dt-note>

                >I say "need" but truly no one needs a phone of any sort. We are
                just so acustom to having a device at hand to distract us and
                such, that not having one seems very difficult.</span

            >a "smart" phone. This has led me to a many year long battle to get
            myself "off" the phone. I'm making progress and from where I used to
            be, I've come a long way, but I do not think I am really "ready" to
            jump ship and pick up a simpler phone just yet.

          <h3>Baby Steps</h3>
          <p>
            I'm going to get there, and some day I won't be one of those people
            with a smart phone in their pocket ready to help them with every
            challenge and pull them away from reality at any moment. So to get
            ever closer to my goal, I have "debloated" my phone<dt-note
              ><span
                >For some context, I don't have social media and I am already
                using a stripped down variant of Android called "GrapheneOS". So
                the "debloat" process for me might be different than for
                you.</span
              ></dt-note
            >. For me this meant deleting a number of apps that serve little
            purpose, easily distract me, or are redundant. For some other apps
            I've opted to "hide" the app instead of uninstalling it. This way
            it's not easily available/present but it is still there if I need it
            for some reason. What I have left is a phone that hopefully will
            occupy my time much less and get me closer to not "needing" one of
            these things at all. It's amazing how even just hiding some apps and
            getting that app-drawer down to a small size can be a relief!

          <h3>She gone!</h3>
          <p>
            The key things I got rid of were Brave and Firefox. I hardly used
            Firefox, but without Brave it would become the default web browser,
            so getting rid of both was crucial. Because I run GrapheneOS, there
            is no default browser, so by deleting the only browsers on my phone,
            I am left without any browsers whatsoever. This will save a vast
            amount of my attention, checking Hackernews had become a real
            problem for me. I've also gone ahead and done away with my VPN
            (Proton), not too much reason to have it around, though I hardly
            ever used it anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other big things I've gotten rid of are my weather app
            (Wunderground), ebook reader, and Raindrop. The weather app might
            come back, I really wasn't glued to that, but I'm going to try
            foregoing it for the tome being and seeing how I do without. The
            ebook reader was rarely used, I have an actually eink ereader I use
            for reading books and this was sort of just redundant. Raindrop was
            kind of moot without a browser, and also could become a source of
            distraction if I started turning to it for things to read/scroll.

          <h3>Hide Aways</h3>
          <p>
            Some of the apps I've opted to keep installed, but hidden, whether
            to keep it out of my mind or just to minimize the number of things
            to look at. These apps include my Epson printer's app, I never use
            it, and without a browser on my phone there is even less chance of
            using it, but it is how the printer is configured, so I thought it
            best to keep it around just in case. My map app, Organic Maps, got
            to stay, but hidden. This is another app I pretty much never use. I
            am very good with directions and rarely do I ever need to consult a
            map to figure out where to go, especially locally since our roads
            are all named in a manner that makes it very easy to find where you
            are going. I've also kept Slack, I only use this app for setting
            myself away when I forget to do so before leaving my computer for
            lunch. Starlink and the VictronConnect app are the final two that
            got to stay, mostly because the two products that they control are
            things that cannot be controlled without the apps,
            annoyingly<dt-note
              ><span
                >The Starlink has minimal functionaly via the browser, but it is
                not as complete as with the app</span
              ></dt-note
            >. The finally pair of apps I've opted to keep, but have hidden are
            the FDroid repo and the Aurora Store. I have kept them so I can
            update my other apps, but I might get rid of these to make it harder
            to install new apps, and instead rely on APK Pure to get updates
            when needed.

          <h3>All that remains</h3>
          <p>
            What remains on my phone (in addition to the default things like
            Contacts, SMS, a calculator, etc.) is my 2FA app for all those
            secondary logins. I might move this to Bitwarden eventually, say if
            I ditch the phone entirely, but until than it's around. Bitwarden
            also got to stay, but in hindsight that might be able to get the
            boot, there is little need for a password manager on a phone without
            anything to log into. I've also kept the Sonos App, Spotify, a Bible
            reading app (Andbible), a podcast app, and a few other utilities --
            like a calorie counter and a run/bike tracker.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think what I've gotten whittled down to is a good start. I am
            already using the phone less, and in fact have been leaving it off
            and at home most days this week. I have been unlocking it, looking
            at it, realizing there is nothing on it to distract me, and then
            turning it off. I suspect that'll cease as I eventually stop seeking
            out my phone for entertainment and distraction purposes.
          </p>
          <p>I will report back after a sufficient time has passed.</p>
