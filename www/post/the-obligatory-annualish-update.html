                Keeping a blog is hard because you have to write stuff
                periodically. It's much easier to build a new one, throw up a
                few posts to make sure it's all working, and than move onto
                another website next year.

            Keeping a blog is hard because you have to write stuff
            periodically. It's much easier to build a new one, throw up a few
            posts to make sure it's all working, and than move onto another
            website next year. My theme for 2025 has been doing hard stuff, so
            instead of taking the easy route, I jumped backed into a code base
            I hadn't looked at in a year, and am going to try and use this
            website for a minute instead of just hopping onto the next one.

            So a lot has changed actually since June of 2024. There's a new
            baby imminently due, I took the next step and actually have a dumb
            phone, and... okay so not too much new actually, just the baby
            really.
          </p>

            Stay tuned, maybe I'll actually write more before another 17 months
            go by.
