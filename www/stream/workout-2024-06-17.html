    This is week two of getting back into exercise and reclaiming
    <a class="u-author" href="/">my</a> body and mind. Today on my one mile run
    I was joined by both Alistair and Estelle. We ran 1.1 miles in exactly 12
    minutes today. Afterwards I managed five sets of kettlebell swings @ 20kg,
    where each set was made up of 10 swings per arm, for a total of 20 swings.
