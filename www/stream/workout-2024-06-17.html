    This is week two of getting back into exercise and reclaiming my body and
    mind. Today on my one mile run I was joined by both Alistair and Estelle. We
    ran 1.1 miles in exactly 12 minutes today. Afterwards I managed five sets of
    kettlebell swings @ 20kg, where each set was made up of 10 swings per arm,
    for a total of 20 swings.
